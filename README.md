Writing a client in Golang

A client which makes GET and POST requests on REST endpoints to capture ever-changing info about openings of wedding venues and wedding bands. End-goal being to find
a matching opening in both and then request those.

This code was written for COMP28112 at UoM as part of coursework. The only requirements being that one can not make requests more often than once a second. Otherwise
students could choose their own language and style of approaching the problem.
